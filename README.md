### ðŸŽ© Hello! Saluton! Salve!

I am a software engineer and community builder who uses technology to unite people and help them discover the answers to their questions through meaningful and delightful interaction. I [speak at conferences](https://github.com/colindean/talks) and have run conferences and conventions since I was 17 years old.

I keep some projects here on GitHub but also some on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/colindean).
I might have something on [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~colindean/) with old stuff on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.com/colindean) and really old stuff from my early development days on [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~colindean).

Organizations I'm involved in:

* [Code & Supply](https://codeandsupply.co) ([gitlab](https://gitlab.com/codeandsupply) & [github](https://github.com/codeandsupply)), Pittsburgh's premiere community of software professionals that hosts meetups, conferences like [Abstractions](https://abstractions.io) and [Heartifacts](https://heartifacts.codeandsupply.co), and runs a [co-working space oriented toward software folks](https://codeandsupply.co/coworking).
* [Community Internet Solutions](https://twitter.com/bringtheweb) (neÃ© [Meta Mesh Wireless Communities](https://metamesh.org)) ([github](https://github.com/metamesh)), a Pittsburgh-based non-profit bridging the digital divide by bringing Internet connectivity to those without it
* [Code & Supply Scholarship Fund](https://codeandsupply.fund) ([gitlab](https://gitlab.com/codeandsupplyfund)), a non-profit that helps folks attend and speak at conferences in Pittsburgh and beyond
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) ([github](https://github.com/homebrew)), the missing package manager for macOS (and Linux)

Want to help me out?
[Join C&S to keep the lights on](https://codeandsupply.co/join) as an individual or corporate member or sponsor us,
[donate to CSSF to fund tech conference travel grants](https://codeandsupply.fund/donate), or
[donate to MMWC to help us build a more connected community](https://metamesh.org).
You could also [sponsor me on GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/colindean) and I'll put the money toward one of these or several other organizations I care about.

Cheers!
