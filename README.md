### Howdy ðŸŽ©

I am a software engineer and community builder who uses technology to unite people and help them discover the answers to their questions through meaningful and delightful interaction.

I keep some projects here on GitHub but also some on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/colindean) and maybe something on [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~colindean/) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.com/colindean) with old stuff from my early development days on [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~colindean).

Organizations I'm involved in:

* [Code & Supply](https://codeandsupply.co) ([gitlab](https://gitlab.com/codeandsupply) & [github](https://github.com/codeandsupply)), Pittsburgh's premeire community of software professionals that hosts meetups, conferences like [Abstractions](https://abstractions.io) and [Heartifacts](https://heartifacts.codeandsupply.co), and runs a co-working space oriented toward software folks.
* [Meta Mesh Wireless Communities](https://metamesh.org) ([github](https://github.com/metamesh)), a Pittsburgh-based non-profit bridging the digital divide by bringing Internet connectivity to those without it
* [Code & Supply Scholarship Fund](https://codeandsupply.fund) ([gitlab](https://gitlab.com/codeandsupplyfund)), a non-profit that helps folks attend and speak at conferences in Pittsburgh and beyond
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) ([github](https://github.com/homebrew)), the missing package manager for macOS (and Linux)

Want to help me out? [Donate to CSSF](https://codeandsupply.fund/donate), [Donate to MMWC](https://metamesh.org), or [join C&S](https://codeandsupply.co/join) as an individual or corporate member.

Cheers!
